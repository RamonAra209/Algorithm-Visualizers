# Algorithm-Visualizers

## Why?
The goal is to implement visualizers for every algorithm gone over in my algorithm's class.
I am a visual learner so I need to see how the algorithm is functioning to fully grasp the content.

## How?
The language of choice is Python. Moreover, I am using the library Pygame to create the graphical interface

## Ok but how do I run it to make sure your code works?
1. Clone the code > cd into directory 
2. Make sure you have python installed
3. Initialize virtual environment with 'python -m venv .venv"
4. run 'source .venv/bin/activate to activate virtual environment 
5. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
6. run 'python3 main.py' (at the moment the menu is console based. I'll make a graphical one later)
7. Pick algorithm and watch it do its thing
